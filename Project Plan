  <h1>CP1406/CP2010 - 2015 - Assignment 2 - Project Plan</h1>
  <h1> Group Assignment</h1>
    <p><strong>Group Name:</strong> Team Unicorn</p> 
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>Promoting the Townsville Community Music Center and improving bussiness involves 
        recruiting and including new members, increasing ticket sales and attendance and to increase the amount of performers.
        </p>
        
  <p> The goal of the website is to increase the number of members of the TCMC and the number of people buying tickets and going 
  to the concerts, as well as getting current and new members more involved. More involved means volunteering or performing, 
  as well as letting TCMC doing promotion for artists. </p>
  
   <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
   <p> An increase in members and sold tickets will point to a successfull web page. To monitor whether members signed up 
   because of the page, this should be a question in the sign-up form. More involvement from current members as well as from
   the new members, as volunteers or performers, indicates that the site has suceeded in the goals, assuming this is the only
   change in advertising from TCMC.</p> 
<p> We can tell if we have succeded with our mission statement if we have:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Improved ticket sales
        </li>
        <li>
            More volunteers helping out 
        </li>
        <li>
            More concerts
        </li>
        <li>
            Have more performers signing up and wanting to perform
        </li>
    
    </ul>      
    </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience is mainly people, male and female, above 40 years old, mostly with a specific taste in music, although with
great diversity. This means adding the possibility of listing artists according to e.g. genre
To accommodate for this age group, the web page should
offer accesability for people with visual impairment, which means appropriate fonts, colour shemes and layout. Use a traditional, 
intuitive navigation that is easy to use, even for people vith varying computer skills. </p>
