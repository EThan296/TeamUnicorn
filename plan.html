  <h1>CP1406/CP2010 - 2015 - Assignment 2 - Project Plan</h1>
  <h1> Group Assignment</h1>
    <p><strong>Group Name:</strong> Team Unicorn</p> 
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>Our mission involves recruiting and including new members/volunteers, increasing ticket sales and attendance, and attracting more performers that want to promote themselves.</p>
  <p>The primary goal of the website is to increase awareness of local talent through promotion of the TCMC-organised concerts.
  
  <!--<p> The goal of the website is to increase the number of members of the TCMC and the number of people buying tickets and going 
  to the concerts, as well as getting current and new members more involved. More involved means volunteering or performing, 
  as well as letting TCMC doing promotion for artists. </p> -->
  
   <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
   <p> An increase in members and sold tickets will point to a successfull web page. To monitor whether members signed up 
   because of the page, this should be a question in the sign-up form. More involvement from current members as well as from
   the new members, as volunteers or performers, indicates that the site has suceeded in the goals, assuming this is the only
   change in advertising from TCMC.</p> 
<p> We can tell if we have succeded with our mission statement if we have:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Improved ticket sales
        </li>
        <li>
            More volunteers helping out 
        </li>
        <li>
            More concerts
        </li>
        <li>
            Have more performers signing up and wanting to perform
        </li>
    
    </ul>      
    </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience is mainly people over 40 years old, mostly with a specific taste in music, although with great diversity (depends on the theme of the concert).</p>
<p>To accommodate for this age group, the web page should offer accessibility for people with visual impairment.  This means appropriate fonts, colour schemes and layout using a traditional, 
intuitive navigation that is easy to use, even for people with varying computer skills. </p>
