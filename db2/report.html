<h2>PMI</h2>
    <p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
    <p><strong>Pluses: </strong>it was good with the division in who did backend/frontend stuff we managed to stick to this for the most part. </p>
    <p><strong>Minuses: </strong>communication problems, especially since we never found a second day we could meet and work. Getting everyone to contribute and get things done on time was the biggest challenge. </p>
    <p><strong>Interesting: </strong>Good way to simulate a real world web design project. </p>
